    <p>BIO:
As you probably already know, I'm Manvir and my hobbies are art and videogames. I took drama for a bit and it was okay but didn't seem like something i wanted to do as a career so i didn't take drama 2 in high school. I eventually ended up trying out programming and i enjoyed it so i'm thinking of getting a job in this field.
